# UML2 Case Studies

Modelling software is usually about abstraction. UML allows for the introduction of custom abstractions using stereotypes and/or profiles. These abstractions can be refined to a lower-level UML description using refinement model transformations. Several refinement transformations are provided to refine such abstractions as 'Observer', 'Singleton' and 'Applet'. Refinement transformations are also provided to refine standard UML elements into lower-level structures, such as associations to public attributes and public attributes to encapsulated attributes (with getter and setter methods).
